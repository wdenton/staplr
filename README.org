* Introduction

* Installation

* Ideas for future sounds

+ In C (record a lot of them then play them all on top of each other---Music at the Same Time)
+ One sound, but extended or shorted (like "Convergence Machine," sort of), perhaps Bach's first cello suite
+ bird song, so it sounds like a single bird or the whole dawn chorus
+ Kushaqua sounds
+ silences from the desk in question, or just ambient sound from that library
