* Ideas for future sounds

+ In C (record a lot of them then play them all on top of each other---Music at the Same Time)
+ One sound, but extended or shorted (like "Convergence Machine," sort of), perhaps Bach's first cello suite
+ Bird song, so it sounds like a single bird or the whole dawn chorus.
+ Move through the circle of fifths, or some other progression
+ Tick per minute as a basis to really keep things locked.
+ Tristan: the Tristan chord (in different octaves), note by note
+ Staplers:  samples of staplers from the different libraries, making a percussive cacophany
